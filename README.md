# Week 10 Mechanical - NAME: ___________ `__/15` 

### All questions pertain to the Python language

#### 1. Assign a dictionary containing two key/value pairs of your choosing to a variable named 'items': (2 points)
<br><br><br><br>


#### 2. Define a function named `add_numbers` that has two parameters and, when invoked, would **return** the sum of the two arguments.  For example: `add_numbers(5, 10)` would return `15`: (2 points)
<br><br><br><br>


#### Assuming the following code...
```python
cats = 2
dogs = 4
```

#### 3. Using string formatting, "insert" the value of the variables `cats` and `dogs` in place of "_x_" and "_y_", to assign the string "**_There are x cats and y dogs_**" to a variable named `pet_msg`: (2 points)
<br><br>

#### 4. Define a function named `more_cats_or_dogs`, that if invoked like this:<br> `result = more_cats_or_dogs(cats, dogs)`<br>would return "cats" or "dogs" (strings) depending upon the larger of the two values being passed in for the `cats` and `dogs` arguments (no need to worry about the values for `cats` and `dogs` being equal): (2 points)
<br><br><br><br>

### Use the following class definition for questions 5, 6, and 7

```python
class Cat:











```

#### 5. Within the class `Cat` above, write an `__init__` constructor method with two parameters: `name` & `age`; that are used to set two instance variables. The result is that your class has properties `name` and `age` that can be accessed from an instance of the class. (3 points)

#### 6. Create an object using the `Cat` class above having a _name_ and _age_ of your choosing.  Assign the new instance to a variable named `my_cat`: (2 points)
<br><br><br><br>

#### 7. Using your `my_cat` object from question 6, print out its name and age in a formatted string. (2 points)
<br><br><br><br>
